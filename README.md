# Kickstarter Project
A huge variety of factors contribute to the success or failure of a project â€” in general, and also on the popular crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. Some of these are able to be quantified or categorized, which allows for the construction of a model to attempt to predict whether a project will succeed or not. The aim of this project is to construct such a model and also to analyse Kickstarter project data more generally, in order to help potential project creators assess whether or not Kickstarter is a good funding option for them, and what their chances of success are.
